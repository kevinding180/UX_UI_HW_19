        <h3>FCC Redesign</h3>
        <p>A redesign of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) government website was undertaken to improve the user experience. Research and testing identified key pain points in the existing site, and a redesign strategy was developed. User-centered design principles were utilized to create a modern and intuitive interface. Navigation, accessibility, and the ability to find information were improved. A responsive layout and clear, concise information architecture were implemented. As a result, engagement and satisfaction were improved.</p>
